# Description

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path. Everything was done from scratch, with my own knowledge and help from Codecademy Community, friends and researchs.

## How to Use

Open <https://bruno-jammming-project.netlify.app/>. It's an application to create and save playlists to your Spotify Account. You cant use your Spotify account because it's in development mode, so I would need to allow you inside my Spotify API account. So, I created a test account you can use to test it properly.
